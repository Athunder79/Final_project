Golf Score Tracker and scorecard


The objective of this project is to develop a web application for golf enthusiasts to track their scores, 
analyze their performance, and improve their game. The app will provide users with a platform to log their 
rounds of golf, record shot details for each hole, and visualize their progress over time.
